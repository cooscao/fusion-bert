What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	In the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets `` , rather than dropping the inflatable raft onto the water in its container , and then activating the gas inflating system by tugging the inflating line , the personnel , who were not trained in the rules of using such a raft , undid the lacing and extracted the raft from its container .	0

What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	The faulty oxygen gas analyzer in compartment < num > and the grossest violations of the rules of operating the technical resources were the most probable causes of the fire in compartment < num > . Absence of a technical crew aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets `` and , as a consequence of this , poor quality preparation of the ship for the cruise , were the preconditions for the accident .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	The conclusion reached by the government commission in the investigation of the circumstances and causes of the demise of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` is unobjective as regards establishing the probable cause of the accident , and as regards the evaluation given to the events that led to the accident 's development and to its tragic outcome , and as a consequence of this , as regards the assessment of the fact itself of the accident and the causes bringing it about .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	Looking at the accident of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` as an isolated case , and because the members of the commission belonged to the integral military-industrial complex , the government commission was incapable of objectively and faithfully revealing the real causes of the high accident rate in the navy , and of giving this the proper assessment .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	Ending our analysis of the tragedy 's development and of the actions of personnel of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` , it should be said that the author does not claim to have the absolute truth in interpreting particular events and facts .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	But he is convinced of one thing : The tragedy of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` was the result of its poor preparation for the cruise , and a consequence of the low combat and occupational training of the crew .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	There still are numerous unanswered questions in the investigation of the circumstances of the accident of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	About `` Deficiencies `` and `` Technical Imperfections `` : As the government commission 's work proceeded , and as the causes of the accident and the real circumstances that led to the demise of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` became ever clearer , an extensive campaign to seek out all possible design deficiencies of the ship that had allegedly led to the tragedy was initiated in the press with the complicity of naval representatives .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	In the < num > January < num > edition of the newspaper IZVESTIYA and in the No . < num > , < num > edition of the journal MORSKOY SBORNIK , Captain #st Rank Kolyada used the Soviet Military Encyclopedia in an attempt to persuade everyone that the submarine `` Komsomolets `` was simply `` a vessel intended for experimentation , specially equipped and fitted out for various tests on new armament and hull structural units , and for experimental research on propulsion units , engines and other technical resources at sea. ``	0

What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	The government decree on adoption of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` by the navy was coordinated with many military leaders , including the naval commander -in- chief and the USSR minister of defense .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	In this respect , contrary to Captain #st Rank Kolyada 's opinion , the submarine `` Komsomolets `` did not require any additional certification .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	All of these elementary truths should have been known to the deputy commander of the division to which the `` Komsomolets `` belonged , and people should not have been misled with fables about `` a vessel intended for experimentation. ``	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	From the very beginning , with assignment of the preliminary specifications in < num > , the submarine `` Komsomolets `` was designed as an experimental ship as regards problems associated with diving depth , and as a fighting ship in all other parameters .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	It has its own history , one which has no relationship to the submarine `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	And so this unseemly history culminated with slander directed at the submarine `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	It reads : `` The `` Komsomolets `` was a unique submarine , and its design deficiencies were also unique in their own way .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	As for `` ensuring this nuclear-powered submarine against accidents , `` the high fire and explosion safety of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` was confirmed by an expert commission appointed by the navy after a hands-on inspection of its condition in the period from < num > to < num > October < num > .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	The fact that even after that deflagration occurred in compartment < num > a fire did n't start in it also attests to the fire safety of compartments of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	If the fire aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets `` had not been extinguished by means of this system , this system is not at fault : fire extinguisher was not delivered to the distressed compartment .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	I am compelled to report , with Comrade Gorbachev in mind specifically , that the rescue chamber had been tested by the first crew of the `` Komsomolets `` during the period of experimental operation with the direct participation of representatives of the designer , the ship building plant and the navy 's search and rescue service , and that the testing involved actual separation of the rescue chamber from the submarine and its surfacing .	0

What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	They feel in this case that their main argument is the absence of obvious words such as `` reliable , `` `` unsinkable `` and `` safe `` from the supposedly official name of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` -- `` experimental torpedo nuclear-powered submarine . ``	0

What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	Moreover there were no sudden fires in electrical equipment aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets `` , the fuel and oil pipelines did n't crack , oxygen did n't flow into the zone of fire , fossil fuel did n't catch fire , and neither titanium , nor the powder of gas generators nor torpedo detonators burned .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	To reassure you , let me give you the full official name of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` : `` deep-sea large nuclear-powered torpedo submarine . ``	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	The author writes : `` The fire aboard the `` Komsomolets `` was altogether unprecedented .	0

What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	But at least because it was the first of its kind , as is true with all prototype ships , initially the `` Komsomolets `` needed further design improvements -- that is , it was not perfect .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	Still , we should be thankful to the writer for his high assessment of the deep-sea qualities of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	The writer Cherkashin also has specific complaints against the design of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` : `` Before `` the red-hot walls of the pipelines ruptured , `` their plastic gaskets melted out , causing the release of high-pressure air into the compartment .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?

What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	And despite this , the conditions under which the fire burned aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets `` may recur , especially if the fans of `` unsoiled uniforms `` and their defenders continue to close their eyes to the bad state of combat and occupational training of submarine crews .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	As for specific complaints regarding the design of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` , there is nothing to say -- Boyko simply did n't have any .	0

What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	If it is n't , then what do we make of the command issued at < num > to deliver fire extinguisher into compartment < num > ? Analysis of the personnel 's actions shows that throughout the entire time of the accident , the attack center of the `` Komsomolets `` was unable to really estimate the situation in the distressed compartments , to really monitor the submarine 's buoyancy and stability , and to take real steps to fight for its survival .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	The detail design of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` was developed to include an LOKh firefighting system equipped with remote control from the control room .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	After the new valves were developed , in < num > the navy placed an assignment to study installation of a remote-controlled LOKh system in submarines , but for some unknown reasons a decision was made not to introduce a remote-controlled LOKh system into the `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	As the division deputy commander Captain #st Rank Kolyada bears a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that such recommendations were not drawn up for the submarine `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	During the accident the leadership of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` did not undertake any action to measure the parameters of the ship 's attitude or determine the elements of its buoyancy and stability , which would have made it possible to forecast the accident 's development .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	Analysis of the actions taken by personnel of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` during the accident showed that the submarine 's leadership had not given the order promptly to take the main turbogear unit -LRB- GTZA -RRB- off line , and then to seal off the bulkhead of compartment < num > .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	Summarizing all of the `` design deficiencies `` of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` stated by Captain #st Rank Kolyada , we can make the following conclusions : Not one of the indicated `` deficiencies `` could have been a cause of the accident ; these `` deficiencies `` are inherent to all or most submarines of the navy .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	< num > . In conclusion we need to examine the `` numerous design imperfections `` revealed in the investigation of the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	But if the highly placed authors of the navy 's remarks believe that all of these `` design peculiarities `` caused the accident and demise of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` , and if they do nothing to prohibit patrol duty by submarines having such `` peculiarities , `` then what should we call them -- criminals or liars ?	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	The government commission left unaddressed many pieces of equipment and devices having deficiencies that were discussed in the examination of the circumstances of the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets `` : the self-contained emergency buoy failed to operate after the submarine 's demise ; the sunken submarine locator failed to operate ; the inflating system of the PSN- < num > life rafts failed to work completely , `` by the book `` ; the survival suits and diving suits are hard to use ; the face masks of the IDA-## apparatus are uncomfortable and unreliable .	0

Now a few words about measures to increase fire protection to submarines and exclude accidents aboard them , developed on the basis of the results of examining the circumstances of the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets `` , and accepted for implementation .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	In August < num > the USSR Council of Ministers published a decree on the results of the examination of the circumstances behind the accident aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets `` , drafted by the naval leadership .	0

What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	There were < num > alternating current distribution panels , nine direct current distribution panels , four alternating current main distribution panels and one direct current main distribution panel -- that is , < num > distribution panels -- within the electric power system of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	Such placement of panels is characteristic of all of the navy 's submarines , and it is not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	The oil reserve 's location in the aft compartment is not a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	As for the overall amount of equipment , compartment < num > aboard the `` Komsomolets `` has less than any of the others .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	There are significantly fewer such openings aboard the `` Komsomolets `` than in other submarines of the navy .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	In particular there are < num > openings in the pressure hull in the aft compartment of a certain third-generation submarine with a compartment < num > of the same size as that in the `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	There were only < num > openings in the pressure hull in compartment < num > of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	< num > . The assertion of the authors of the remark that the distribution panels aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets `` are not protected from the influence of oil vapor is inconsistent with reality .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	This system for removing oil vapor from air is also used aboard other submarines of the navy , and the `` Komsomolets `` is not unique in this .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	In all of the time that the `` Komsomolets `` was in operation , not a single case of oil getting on equipment in any compartment was documented .	0

The shafting of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` is designed in full correspondence with Article X-## of the TPPL-## , which contains no requirement regarding the airtightness of bulkheads when shafting is operating at elevated pressure , as is asserted by the authors of the remark .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	As far as the essence of the issue is concerned , the bulkhead between compartments < num > and < num > is airtight aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets `` when the shafting is operating under normal conditions and at elevated pressure -LRB- within normal conditions -RRB- .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	However , the RBITS never was written by the Naval Institute No . < num > , and the navy 's Main Directorate for Operation and Repair did not plan or support its development for the `` Komsomolets `` in time .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	The detail design for the submarine `` Komsomolets `` was drawn up with an LOKh system that could be started remotely from the attack center in accordance with requirements of the specifications and the TPPL- < num > .	0

S- ##/###### , < num > October < num > , of the USSR Ministry of Ship Building Industry and the navy prescribed replacement of these valves aboard all submarines by manually controlled fittings , which is what was done on the `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	A manually started LOKh system is used on most submarines , and therefore the assertion of the authors of the remark that this was a peculiarity of the submarine `` Komsomolets `` is inconsistent with reality .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	In this case for unknown reasons the navy decided not to install the system in the submarine `` Komsomolets `` , and it did not foresee completion of these developments for this ship .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	It is consequently wrong for the navy to lodge any complaints about the absence of a remotely started LOKh system aboard the submarine `` Komsomolets `` .	0

What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	The electric power systems of all submarines of the navy are built on the basis of this principle , such that this is not a peculiarity of just the submarine `` Komsomolets `` .	0
What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	The cables in the submarine `` Komsomolets `` were not disconnected not because it was a major emergency situation , as the authors of the remark assert , but only because the personnel did not know what had to be disconnected due to the absence of the RBITS , and because they never practiced this operation in ship damage control training .	0

What nuclear-powered Russian submarine sank in the Norwegian Sea on April < num > , < num > ?	Concluding our examination of this issue , we should say that after the fire in the `` Korund `` console was put out , the attack center did not transmit the command `` All clear from the damage control alarm `` Fire in compartment < num > ! `` , `` and it did not order delivery of power to distribution panels RShchN No . < num > and < num > , which was another mistake by the submarine 's leadership .	0
